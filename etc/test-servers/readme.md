This folder contains a bunch of tests servers that respond in various
ways (simple, chunked, large responses, etc). Since we just need some
simple test services the following have been written in NodeJS (v0.10.26).

The names of the files should be pretty representative of how the server
behaves. To run a file, just `node FILENAME.js`.
